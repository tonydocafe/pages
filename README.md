# ‚ú® Welcome to my Static Portfolio! ‚ú®

Hi, curious visitor! Welcome to the repository that powers my static website, where I share my projects, interests, and a little bit about what I'm up to at the moment!

üåê **Access my portfolio here:** [tonydocafe.github.io/to-know-more-about-me](https://tonydocafe.github.io/to-know-more-about-me/)

## üîç What is this?
This repository contains the files that make up my static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as a digital portfolio to showcase the projects I'm working on and the topics that interest me the most at the moment.

## üõ†Ô∏è How is it organized?
The website is structured in a simple and efficient way, using HTML, JavaScript, and images:

- **`index.html`** - The heart of the website! Here is the entire main structure of the page.
- **`js/`** - Contains all the magic of interactivity, divided into three files:
- `view.js` - Responsible for everything that appears on the screen.
- `controller.js` - The boss! It manages the communication between the view and the data.
- `model.js` - Stores the important information for the website to work.
- **`images/`** - A gallery of images used on the website (because a beautiful portfolio needs images, right?).
